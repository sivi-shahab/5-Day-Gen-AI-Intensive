You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

His days were filled with naps, chasing dust bunnies, and meticulously grooming his whiskers. But one particularly breezy afternoon, a rogue gust of wind swept open the back door, and Bartholomew, ever the curious soul, found himself outside.\n\nThe world was a sensory explosion. The scent of blooming honeysuckle, the rustle of leaves, the chirping of unseen birds, all assaulted Bartholomew's senses. He was a cat adrift in a vast, green ocean. He cautiously ventured into the garden, his sleek body weaving through the tangle of rose bushes. A flash of blue caught his eye, a magnificent, iridescent butterfly fluttering among the daisies. \n\nBartholomew, fueled by a newfound sense of adventure, stalked his quarry. He padded through the tall grass, his tail twitching with anticipation. He leaped, missing his target by a hair's breadth. But he didn't give up. The chase was exhilarating, a symphony of sunbeams and rustling leaves. He chased the butterfly through the garden, over the fence, and into the bustling street beyond.\n\nThe world was a whirlwind of sights and smells. Cars zoomed past, their horns blaring, people hurried by, their voices a cacophony. Bartholomew, momentarily overwhelmed, sought refuge in the shade of a towering oak. He watched a squirrel scampering up the trunk, its tail flicking back and forth. He envied its freedom, its ability to navigate this strange, wonderful world.\n\nSuddenly, a high-pitched meow pierced the air. Bartholomew turned to see a tiny, fluffy kitten, its eyes wide with fear, trapped between two parked cars. Bartholomew, remembering his own fear at the chaotic street, knew he had to help. He approached the kitten cautiously, his own meow soft and reassuring. He led the kitten through a gap in the parked cars, back to the safety of the garden. \n\nThe kitten, grateful and trusting, nuzzled against Bartholomew's fur. It was then, in the quiet of the garden, that Bartholomew felt a deep sense of satisfaction. He had faced his fears, explored the unknown, and even helped someone in need. The world, he realized, was full of wonders and challenges, and he, a ginger tabby with a penchant for sunbeams and tuna, was ready to face them all.  \n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the garden, Bartholomew made his way back home. He slipped through the open back door, the scent of familiar comfort filling his senses. He curled up on his favorite cushion, the adventure etched in his memory, and purred himself to sleep. He was a cat of habit, but now, with a dash of adventure in his heart, he was also a cat of courage. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.
